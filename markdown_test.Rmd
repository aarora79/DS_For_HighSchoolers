## Introduction to the Cars Dataset

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
avg_speed = mean(cars$speed)
cat(sprintf("average speed is %d", round(avg_speed)))

quantile(cars$speed, c(0.05, 0.95))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
